Dynamic cast when source expression is null

I noticed that different simulators (or even different versions of the same simulator) show different behavior about dynamic cast when source expression evaluates to null. See LRM (IEEE 1800-2012), paragraph 8.16.

I wonder which simulator is correctly interpreting the LRM when the source expression evaluates to null in every possible "flavor".

This is just an exercise for getting started with GitHub.
